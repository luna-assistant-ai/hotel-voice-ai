## Transform Your Guest Experience with Conversational Intelligence

## The Problem: Hospitality's Communication Gap

**Today's Reality:**
- 60% of hotel calls go unanswered during peak hours
- Front desk staff juggle check-ins, inquiries, and reservations simultaneously
- Guests wait on hold for simple requests: "Do you have availability?", "What time is breakfast?"
- International guests struggle with language barriers and timezone differences
- Revenue loss: Every missed call is a potential booking walking to a competitor

**The Hidden Cost:**
- Lost bookings: $5,000-$15,000 per month (industry average for 100-room property)
- Staff overtime and burnout managing call overflow
- Negative reviews from poor phone experiences
- Missed upsell opportunities (room upgrades, spa services, dining)
