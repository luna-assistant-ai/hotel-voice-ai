# Voice AI Pilot Framework
## One-Page Pilot Proposal for Hotel Partners

---

## Pilot Objective
Validate Voice AI Assistant's business value in a real-world hotel environment with minimal risk and maximum learning.

---

## Pilot Scope

### Duration
**30-60 days** (hotel's preference)

### Implementation Approach
**Option A - After Hours Only** (Lowest Risk)
- AI handles calls outside 8 AM - 8 PM (hotel operating hours)
- Tests overnight/early morning booking capture
- Zero disruption to daytime operations
- Staff available for handoff if needed

**Option B - Overflow Support** (Moderate Risk)
- AI handles calls when front desk is busy (>2 rings)
- Tests peak period support
- Staff maintains primary call responsibility
- AI acts as safety net

**Recommended:** Start with Option A, expand to Option B if successful

### Use Cases (Pilot Phase)
**In Scope:**
- ✅ Room availability inquiries
- ✅ Standard booking requests (1-2 rooms, standard dates)
- ✅ Hotel information (amenities, location, policies)
- ✅ Booking retrieval and confirmation

**Out of Scope (Pilot):**
- ❌ Group bookings (5+ rooms)
- ❌ Payment processing (handled post-pilot)
- ❌ Complex special requests
- ❌ Guest service requests (room service, housekeeping)

**Handoff Protocol:** AI transfers to staff for out-of-scope requests

## Risk Mitigation

### Technology Risks
**Risk:** AI makes incorrect statements or bookings
- **Mitigation:** Human oversight during pilot, staff can monitor all calls
- **Fallback:** Immediate handoff to staff if AI uncertain
- **Insurance:** All bookings confirmed via email with staff review option

**Risk:** System downtime or technical issues
- **Mitigation:** 99%+ uptime SLA, automatic failover to staff
- **Fallback:** Calls route to front desk if AI unavailable
- **Support:** 24/7 technical support during pilot

### Operational Risks
**Risk:** Staff resistance or lack of adoption
- **Mitigation:** Early involvement, training, feedback loops
- **Fallback:** Can disable AI routing at any time
- **Incentive:** Frame as staff support tool, not replacement

**Risk:** Guest dissatisfaction with AI interaction
- **Mitigation:** Professional voice, natural conversation, clear handoff option
- **Fallback:** Staff can intervene on any call
- **Monitoring:** Post-call surveys to catch issues early

### Business Risks
**Risk:** No measurable ROI or business value

## Appendix: Sample Pilot Scenarios

### Scenario 1: After-Hours Booking (Success Case)
**11:30 PM - Guest calls hotel**
- Guest: International traveler arriving tomorrow, needs last-minute booking
- AI: Checks availability, quotes rate, collects details, confirms reservation
- Result: Booking captured that would have been missed (front desk closed)
- Revenue: $450 (3-night stay)

### Scenario 2: Overflow Support (Success Case)
**2:00 PM - Check-in rush hour**
- Front desk managing 5 guests checking in simultaneously
- Phone rings, guest wants to know about parking
- AI: Answers call, provides parking information, offers to book parking spot
- Result: Front desk continues check-ins uninterrupted, caller satisfied
- Time saved: 5 minutes

### Scenario 3: Complex Request (Handoff Case)
**7:00 PM - Guest calls with special request**
- Guest: Needs wheelchair-accessible room + late check-in + birthday surprise setup
- AI: Recognizes complexity, says "Let me connect you with our team for special arrangements"
- Result: Smooth transfer to front desk staff, who handles personalized request
- Outcome: Appropriate escalation, guest appreciates human touch

### Scenario 4: Repeat Caller (Learning Case)
**Multiple calls from same guest**
- Call 1: Guest asks about availability for next month
- Call 2 (next day): Same guest calls back to book
- AI: Doesn't recognize returning caller (Phase 1 limitation)
- Result: Guest repeats information, minor friction
- Learning: Opportunity for future enhancement (caller ID integration)
